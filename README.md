The files included in this gist were recorded using the same laptop, the same transmitting radio (a Radioddity GD77), and the same receiving radio (a Baofeng UV5R).

The file [test-uca202.wav](test-uca202.wav) was recorded with a random USB sound card I had lying around.

The files [test-digirig1.wav](test-digirig1.wav), [test-digirig2.wav](test-digirig2.wav), and [test-digirig3.wav](test-digirig3.wav) were recorded using three different digirig devices that I ordered over the past couple of weeks.
